Thanks for sharing this really important information today, Mary. I know how difficult it can be to answer sensitive questions like these. It's great to hear that you have a steady place to live and aren't experiencing any threats or physical harm from others. However, it seems like you've had some challenges with utilities being shut off and sometimes experience people insulting or talking down to you, which can be really tough. I'm also glad to hear that transportation and food haven't been major obstacles for you lately, although it sounds like there are times when it's a worry. I'll be sure to share this information with your provider so that they are aware and can talk to you about any of these things if you would like.

Thank you for completing the survey.
