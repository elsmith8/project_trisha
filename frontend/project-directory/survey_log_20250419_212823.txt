User Response: Yes
Bot Response: Here's a summary of your responses:

Thanks for sharing this important information with me today, Erica. It sounds like you have a stable place to live, which is great. However, it seems that you've experienced your utilities being shut off, which must be really stressful. It's understandable to be concerned about food running out sometimes. Transportation doesn't appear to be an issue for you in getting to appointments or work. While it seems no one is physically hurting you, it's never okay for others to insult you or scream and curse at you. I appreciate you taking the time to share these details, as it will help your provider have a more complete picture of your current situation and any support you may need.

Thank you for completing the survey.
