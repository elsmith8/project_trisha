Bot Response: Here's a summary of your responses:

Thanks for sharing this really important information today, Mary. I know how difficult it can be to answer sensitive questions like these. It's great to hear that you have a stable place to live and don't need any help with work, school, or training right now. It sounds like transportation hasn't been a barrier for you in accessing healthcare or other necessities. However, it seems like you've had some challenges with affording food and have experienced the utility company threatening to shut off services in your home, which can be really stressful. Fortunately, it doesn't sound like you're dealing with anyone treating you poorly or making you feel unsafe.

Thank you for completing the survey.
