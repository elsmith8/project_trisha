Dear Erica,

While you indicated that you do not need assistance with employment or education at this time, please know that there are resources available to help with food and utility needs if you ever require support. It's also concerning that you have experienced occasional verbal mistreatment from others. If you ever feel unsafe or need help, please don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider or local support services.

Sincerely,
TRISHA

Thank you for completing the survey.
