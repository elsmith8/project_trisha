Bot Response: Here's a summary of your responses:

Thanks for sharing this really important information today, Mary. I know how difficult it can be to answer sensitive questions like these. It's great to hear that you have a steady place to live and aren't experiencing problems with your living situation. It seems like you're doing well with work, school, and transportation. However, it's concerning that the utility company has threatened to shut off services in your home, and that you sometimes experience people insulting or talking down to you. I'll be sure to share this information with your provider so that they are aware and can talk to you about any of these things if you would like.

Thank you for completing the survey.
